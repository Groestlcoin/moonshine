> GRS Moonshine is a homebrewed, open-source, non-custodial, Groestlcoin Electrum wallet for iOS & Android.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
This app is still heavily in development. Please use at your own risk.

Built with React Native, GRS Moonshine utilizes Electrum's JSON-RPC methods to interact with the Bitcoin/Litecoin network.

GRS Moonshine's intended use is as a hot wallet.
Meaning, your keys are only as safe as the device you install this wallet on.
As with any hot wallet, please ensure that you keep only a small, responsible amount of Bitcoin/Litecoin on it at any given time.

If you are looking for secure cold storage solutions please consider purchasing a [Trezor](https://wallet.trezor.io) or a [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)

### Installation
1. First and foremost, we need to generate the Lndmobile.aar & Lndmobile.framework files.
    - Option 1 - Generate them locally:
        - To generate these files, please follow the instructions detailed in the README of Lightning Lab's Lightning App [here.](https://github.com/lightninglabs/lightning-app/tree/master/mobile)
    - Option 2 - Download pre-generated files:
        - If you do not wish to generate these files locally you can download them [here](https://github.com/coreyphillips/moonshine/releases/tag/v0.2.0-2) instead. However, I highly recommend you opt for option 1.
2. Clone GRS Moonshine and Install Dependencies:
   ```
    git clone https://github.com/Groestlcoin/moonshine
    cd moonshine
    yarn install
    ```
3. Add the Lndmobile.aar & Lndmobile.framework files to the project:
    - Add the Lndmobile.aar file to `moonshine/android/Lndmobile`
    - Add the Lndmobile.framework file to `moonshine/ios/lightning`

4. Start the project:
    - iOS: `react-native run-ios`
    - Android: `react-native run-android`

### Altcoin Support
Please be aware and take note that my primary focus is on expanding the core functionality of this wallet and not on adding altcoins. However, for those wishing to add a specific altcoin for personal use, I have created the following guide so that you may fork off in a proper fashion:
[Altcoin Implementation Guide](https://gist.github.com/coreyphillips/91de5d15964797054988522664cc3150)
 
 If you have any questions regarding this guide I'm always happy to help so don't hesitate to reach out.
